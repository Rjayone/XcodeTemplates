# Xcode Templates
The collection of Xcode templates

# Installation
First of all you need to create `File Templates`:

`mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Source`

The `Source` is the name of section where template appears.
If you want to see you template into first line when you are creating a file - use Source.
